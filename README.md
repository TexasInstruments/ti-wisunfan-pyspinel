# TI Wi-SUN FAN Spinel CLI Reference

The TI Wi-SUN FAN Spinel CLI exposes the configuration and management APIs running on a TI Wi-SUN FAN Network Co-Processor (NCP) via a command line interface. This tool is primarily suitable for manual experimentation with controlling TI Wi-SUN FAN NCP instances and is NOT meant for expanding into production grade driver software for TI Wi-SUN FAN NCP devices.

This tool will be helpful for following purposes:

1. As a path to automated testing and performing field trials with TI Wi-SUN FAN NCP running on TI SimpleLink devices.
2. As a simple debugging tool for NCP builds of TI-WiSUN FAN stack.

## Quick start

The TI Wi-SUN FAN spinel-cli tool provides an intuitive command line interface for interacting with and controlling TI SimpleLink devices running TI Wi-SUN FAN stack software.

First, build the TI Wi-SUN FAN NCP Border router and router node binaries from the SDK. Flash the images onto the devices.

Then run the Pyspinel CLI:

```
$ cd <path-to-pyspinel>
$ spinel-cli.py -u /dev/ttyUSB0
spinel-cli > ncpversion
TIWISUNFAN/1.0.0; RELEASE; Jul  9 2021 20:26:46

For the full list of commands and help on individual commands use the [help](#help) command. Please note that any configuration of the TI Wi-SUN FAN stack should be done before bringing up the interface (ifconfig up) and starting the Wi-SUN FAN stack (wisunstack start).

- [panrediscover](#panrediscover)

#### networkname

Get or set the Wi-SUN FAN network name.

```bash
spinel-cli > networkname Wi-SUN NET
Done
spinel-cli > networkname
Wi-SUN NET
Done
```

#### ifconfig

Bring up or down the Wi-SUN FAN Network Interface. ifconfig down functionality is currently not implemented and will be done in future.

```bash
spinel-cli > ifconfig up
Done
```

#### wisunstack

Display the Operational status of the Wi-SUN FAN network. Can also be used to enable/disable Wi-SUN stack operation and attach to/detach from a Wi-SUN network. "wisunstack start" command should be preceeded by "ifconfig up" command. For router node, even though the stack is brought up, it takes some time for the node to join the network and become operational. Refer to routerstate command for more info.
wisunstack stop functionality is currently not implemented and will be done in future. Till then use 'reset' command to stop all operations and issue 'ifconfig up' and 'wisunstack start' to start the Wi-SUN network again.

```bash
spinel-cli > wisunstack start
Done
spinel-cli > wisunstack
start
Done
```

#### wisundirect
Note that after enabling wisundirect on Border Router, PAN Configuration will no longer be transmitted.
This is to ensure consistent bootstrap state for joining nodes.

Turn Wi-SUN direct mode on. Off by default. Only intended to be used by Border Router devices. This enables a specific message header, allowing link-local unicast messages from the Border Router to be TX'ed and RX'ed properly by devices that are not fully joined. Both devices must have security exchange disabled (use preshared keys). wisundirect command should be called before interface/stack up.

After calling wisundirect on, use ping or coap commands with a MAC address in the `<address>` field to send packets to a specific HW MAC address. Both devices must have exchanged at least one PAN advertisement solicit/PAN advertisement for this ping/coap command to go through.

Note that after enabling wisundirect on Border Router, PAN Configuration will no longer be transmitted. This is to ensure consistent bootstrap state for joining nodes.

```bash
> wisundirect
Wi-SUN direct mode off
> wisundirect on
Turn Wi-SUN direct mode on
```

#### routerstate

Display the current join state of the Wi-SUN FAN router device. Refer to the FAN 1.0 specification for information on different states of the Wi-SUN FAN router devices before it can join a network and become operational.

```bash
spinel-cli > routerstate
5
Successfully joined and operational
Done
```

#### numconnected

```bash
spinel-cli > ipv6addresstable
fd00:7283:7e00:0:212:4b00:1ca1:9463; prefix_len = 64; valid_lifetime = 43129; preferred_lifetime = 21529

```bash
spinel-cli > ping fd00:7283:7e00:0:212:4b00:1ca1:9463
56 bytes from fd00:7283:7e00:0:212:4b00:1ca1:9463: icmp_seq=50089 hlim=64 time=118ms
```

#### multicastlist

#### setpanidlistjson

Set the JSON file used to set the panid allow/deny list for new coap nodes joining the network.
If this file is not set or does not exist, you can still use setpanidlist and panrediscover manually.
You MUST build coap node projects with the `COAP_PANID_LIST` predefine to use this functionality.

See `panid_list_example.json` for an example JSON file. Some important notes about this JSON file:
* Each entry key is an EUI addresses, which  can be retrieved from devices via Uniflash.
* EUI address keys MUST be capitalized in the file or they will fail to match.
* spinel-cli.py must be running for the JSON contents to update to the coap node.
* setpanidlistjson must be called each time spine-cli.py is initated on the BR device.
* Intermediate router device are not valid for JSON PAN ID filter lists, as coap nodes only communicate
  with BR devices of the network.

Some details about allow/deny filter list:
* If the allowlist is set, the denylist is ignored. Only when the allowlist is empty is the denylist considered. See the
  rediscovery rules below for the explicit rediscovery decision.
* The current PAN ID filter list on coap devices only has 3 entries for allowlist and 5 entries for denylist.
  Additional entires will be ignored.
* PAN ID filter lists  are not stored in non-volatile memory. They are not preserved on reset.
* The PAN ID filter lists are automatically cleared if the device is unable to join a network after a
  certain timeout period. This timeout value is 30 minutes by default, but can be configured with the `PANID_LIST_TIMEOUT_SEC`.
  parameter in spinel-cli.py

Some further details on the JSON update process
* When a coap node joins the network, it will send a join indication message to the BR with its EUI. The BR will
  scan the JSON file for this EUI.
    * If a matching EUI is found, the BR will send the contents to the joined coap node, which will update its internal PAN ID
      filters with this new info. This does not replace current entries already in the list but instead appends to them.
        * The exception to the append rule is if a new PAN ID entry being added to the allowlist is currently in the
          denylist, or vice versa. To allow the new entry to take precedence, the old entry on the opposite list is
          removed first before adding the new entry.
    * If a match is not found, the BR will assume it knows nothing about the node and does not want it to join. It will
      update the joined coap node with a new denylist entry containing its own PAN ID, triggering a rediscovery.
    * If setpanidlistjson is not called after initializing spinel-cli or the file passed is deleted, the JSON is not
      available. It is assumed direct control via the other panidlist APIs is desired, so the update message to the
      joining coap node will not modify its current PAN ID filters.
* After the update process, the coap node will read its current PAN ID filter lists and decide whether a PAN rediscovery
  (network restart) is needed.
    * If the allowlist is not empty:
        * If the current PAN ID is in the allowlist, then no rediscovery is needed
        * If the current PAN ID is not present, then rediscovery is needed
    * If the allowlist is empty and the denylist is not empty:
        * If the current PAN ID is in the denylist, rediscovery is needed
        * If the current PAN ID is not in the denylist, rediscovery is not needed
    * If both the allowlist and denylist are empty, no rediscovery is needed
